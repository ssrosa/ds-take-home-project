    "# Measuring Simultaneous Change in Two Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sectino you have been learning about random variables. You've learned that the set of possible values of a random variable may be measured and plotted with a distribution, and you've learned about some of this distribution's parameters, the mean and the standard deviation. In the previous lesson you learned that the standard deviation ($\\sigma$, lower-case sigma) measures how the data in a distribution are dispersed away from the mean value. The standard deviation is useful to measure the spread of the distribution a single random variable. But what if we want to compare the spreads of two different random variables? Two distributions that change together in a positive or negative way might share a relationship, and observing and measuring such a relationship may yield the sort of insights that a data scientist could present to their organization. We can measure how the distributions of two random variables change together using variance, covariance, and correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "* calculate the variance of the distribution of a random variable based on its standard deviation\n",
    "* calculate the covariance and correlation of the distributions of two random variables\n",
    "* distinguish covariance and correlation and use the results of each measure to make obversations about the relationship between two random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$) and Variance ($\\sigma^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the standard deviation measures the spread of values away from the mean of a distribution in one direction, then its square, variance, measures the spread away in both directions. It tells us how much the data varies from its mean. Let's look at an uncontroversial example: carrot length. Let's assume that carrot length is a normally-distributed random variable, and let's say that the mean length of 1000 carrots in a produce market is 20cm."

    "In this lesson, we shall look at how **Variance** of a random variable is used to calculate **Covariance** and **Correlation**, two key measures used in Statistics for finding the relationships between random variables. These measures help us identify the degree to which two set of data tend to deviate from their expected value (i.e. mean), in a similar way. Based on these measures, we can identify if two variable are dependent on each other, and to what extend. This lesson will help you develop a conceptual understanding, necessary calculations and some precautions while using these measures. \n",

    "> __Variance is a measure used to quantify how much a random variable deviates from its mean value__. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate variance, we are essentially asking, \"__Given the relationship of all given data points, how much distant from mean do we expect the next data point to be?__\"  This \"distance\" is called the **error term**, and it's what variance is measuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is shown using notatioin $\\sigma^2$. Previously, we have seen $\\sigma$ as a measure of standard deviation within a given dataset.

    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple application of this measure could be associating probabilities with predicted future events in a market research activity, identifying them as \"very likely\" or \"unlikely\" etc. Most people are risk averse, in that they wish to minimize the amount of risk they must endure to earn a certain level of expected return. If investors were indifferent to risk, they would not be influenced by the differences between stock A and stock B above, whereas the risk-averse investor would clearly prefer stock A. Therefore, most people want to know the range or dispersion(spread/deviation as we termed it earlier) of possible outcomes, as well as the likelihood of certain outcomes occurring. Variance measure is a great way to find all of the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range defined by the underlying data. \n",

    "Conglomo's distribution of returns is more concentrated than Bilco's, as illustrated by Conglomo's relatively wider bell curve. A more concentrated distribution is defined as having a smaller standard deviation. The distribution curve appears higher, steeper, and narrower because more observations are occurring close to the expected return. Bilco's distribution is rather flat, reflecting that its returns are less concentrated, or more dispersed, than those of Conglomo Inc.\n",

    "\n",
    "A variance value of zero represents that all of the values within a data set are identical, while all variances that are not equal to zero will come in the form of positive numbers. The larger the variance, the more spread in the data set. A large variance means that the numbers in a set are far from the mean and each other. A small variance means that the numbers are closer together in value. \n",
    "### How to Calculate Variance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is calculated by:\n",
    "1. Taking the differences between each element in a data set and the mean, \n",
    "2. Squaring those differences to give it a positive value\n",
    "3. Dividing the sum of the resulting squares by the number of values in the set.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $x$ represents an individual data point and $\\mu$ represents the mean of the data points. $N$ is the total number of data points. Remember that while calculating a sample variance in order to estimate a population variance, the denominator of the variance equation becomes n - 1. This removes bias from the estimation, as it prohibits the researcher from underestimating the population variance.\n",

    "## Correlation \n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we saw how covariance can identify the degree to which two random variables tend to vary together, while using a formulation that depends on the units of $X$ and $Y$ variables. During data analysis, covariance measure can not be directly used in data comparison as it different experiments may contain underlying data, measured in different units. For this, we need to normalize this degree of variation into a standard unit, with interpretable results independent of the units of data. We achieve this with a derived normalized measure, called correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is defined as covariance, normalized by the square rooted product of standard deviations of $X$ and $y$. This normalization helps us set the scale from 0 to 1. So the correlation between 𝑋 and 𝑌 would be calculated as:\n",

For example, the digital publisher runs the correlation report between hourly Twitter mentions and visits for a two week period. The correlation is found to be r = 0.28, which indicates a medium, positive relationship between Twitter mentions and website visits.\n",

For example, an e-retailer wants to compare a number of secondary success events (e.g., file downloads, product detail page views, internal search click-throughs, etc.) with weekly web revenue. They can quikly identify internal search click-throughs as having the highest correlation, which may indicate an area for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Correlation Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "__Coefficient of correlation__, r, called the linear correlation coefficient, measures the strength and the direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It also called as __Pearson correlation coefficient__. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we shall focus on Pearson correlation as it is the go-to correlation measure for most needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson __r__ correlation is the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between two linearly related variables. For the Pearson r correlation, both variables should be normally distributed (normally distributed variables have a bell-shaped curve). Other assumptions include linearity and homoscedasticity. Linearity assumes a straight line relationship between each of the two variables and homoscedasticity assumes that data is equally distributed about the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Coefficient of Correlation (r)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson Correlation (r) is calculated using following formula :\n",
    "\n",

A correlation value of -0.9 means that the change is one variable results as an opposite change in the other variable. A pearson correlation near 0 would be no effect.

    "### So how do these measures relate to each other ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are Covariance and Correlation The Same Thing? Simply put, no.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both covariance and correlation indicate whether variables are positively or inversely related to each other, they are not considered to be the same. This is because correlation also informs about the degree to which the variables tend to move together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is used to measure variables that have different units of measurement. By leveraging covariance, analysts are able to determine weather units are increasing or decreasing, but they are unable to solidify the degree to which the variables are moving together due to the fact that covariance does not use one standardized unit of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes the measure of interdependence between two variables and informs researchers as to how closely the two variables move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lesson, we looked at Identifying the variance of random variables as a measure of mean deviation. We saw how this measure can be used to first calculate covariance, followed by the correlation to analyze how change variable effects the change of another variable. Next, we shall see how we can use correlation analysis to run a __regression analysis__ and later, how covariance calculation helps us with dimensionality reduction. "
